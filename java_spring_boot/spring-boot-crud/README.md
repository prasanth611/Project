# CRUD operations with entities Student and Course that implements many-to-many relationship

## Pre requisites
- \>= Java 8
- \>= MySQL(5.6)
- Create database with name admin_university

## Setup Guide
1. Login to your mysql terminal and create mysql database with following command : 
```
  create database admin_university;
```
2. Clone the repo and change the application.properties file
  - Change the \<username\> to your Mysql Username
  - Change the \<password\> to your Mysql Password

3. Go to root directory that is ~/spring-boot-crud and run the following command
```
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

If Step 1 and 2 are properly configured, you will see **Tomcat started on port(s): 8080**. Now use the Postman collection mentioned at bottom to explore the APIs.

## Brief Introduction of APIs 
1. There are 8 APIs for student and courses,which contains CRUD for each.
2. JSON for Student as follows : 
```
{
    "name" : "Student A",
    "courses" : [
        {"id" : 1}
    ]
}
```
In above Student JSON, courses field is optional. 

3. JSON for Courses as follows : 
```
{
    "name" : "Course A"
}
```

## Project Architecture
1. MVC pattern is used to seggregate the functionality,and the view part is not being used for now.
2. A dedicated Repository folder is used to change the datasource with minimal changes. 
3. Outline of Core logic folder is as follows : 
  ```
  -- springbootcrud
    |-- SpringBootCrudApplication.java
    |-- controller
    |   |-- CourseController.java
    |   `-- StudentController.java
    |-- model
    |   |-- Course.java
    |   `-- Student.java
    |-- repository
    |   |-- CourseRepository.java
    |   `-- StudentRepository.java
    `-- service
        |-- CourseService.java
        |-- CourseServiceImpl.java
        |-- StudentService.java
        `-- StudentServiceImpl.java

  ```

## Entities are as follows
- Student (id, name)
- Course (id,name)
- An intermediate entity known as student_courses is generated by JPARepository ORM which holds mapping of both tables

## Future Plans
1. To create a generic response (a service layer) for success and failure. 
2. Search through a specific student or course.
3. Lean the Student API, currently all courses are attached with student object who have association with it.
4. Include Pagination.
